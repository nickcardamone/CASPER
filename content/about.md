### Who are we?
Our team is led by two implementation scientists (Dr. Nate Williams and Dr. Rinad Beidas) and
statistician (Dr. Steve Marcus). As NIMH-funded investigators, our team understands the challenges of
multilevel power analysis in implementation science and has the expertise needed to create an open
resource that benefits the entire implementation research community.
### Who do we seek participation from?
After screening abstracts for all NIMH-funded implementation studies in NIH RePORTER, we identified projecs likely to contain information essential to our investigation.
### What do we ask of our participanting researchers?
From your funded grant, our team has identified one published report or RePORTER abstract
from which we are seeking design parameter information related to three key statistics: intraclass
correlation coefficient (ICC), effect size (d), and covariate R<sup>2</sup>.
### Do we reanalyze the results of studies?
No. We are not replicating the results of original studies. We are seeking additional design
parameter information that was not available in the published report or grant abstracts.
### Will design parameters be linked to their original project or publication?
No. Only pooled estimates of central tendency, dispersion, and range will be presented in all reports
and presentations. Anypredictive model we develop will rely on pooled meta-analytic estimates.
