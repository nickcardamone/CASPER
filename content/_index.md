Welcome to **CASPER**: Calculating Accurate Sample Size and Parameter Estimates for Research. Here is some info about us:


* Our team is led by two implementation scientists (Dr. Nate Williams and Dr. Rinad Beidas) and a statistician (Dr. Steve Marcus).
* Our NIMH-funded (R21MH126076) study aims to create a model that enables investigators to efficiently determine required sample sizes for
multilevel implementation studies in mental health settings by pooling information from multiple
projects.
* Drawing on NIMH-funded implementation studies from the last 10 years, the project will:

* generate pooled estimates and ranges of design parameters needed for multilevel power analysis (e.g. ICC, effect size)
* generate a model that investigators can use to determine the required sample size for their study based on its characteristics.
